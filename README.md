Project Overview

This project was built to help users generate professional resumes quickly while maintaining strong document structure and readability.

The application guides users through structured data collection, provides real-time preview, and exports a clean PDF version of the CV.

The focus of this project was to simulate a real production product rather than a simple form application.
